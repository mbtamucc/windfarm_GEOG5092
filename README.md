# windfarm_GEOG5092
geog5092 programming and automation group project


About the files: 

multiple functions were utilized for this project (reproject, mask, rasterize vectors, compute slope and aspect, zonal stats)

windfarm suitability analysis was parsed into its own file 'windfarm_suitabiltyanalysis.py'

suit_windfarm.tif is the resulting tif of the suitability analysis

*********this is still a work in progress as zonal stats, and compute slopeAspect are not fully functional*******
